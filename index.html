        Hello,
        <br>
        As the second line of text on this website says, this is a location on the Internet.
        <br>
        It's very very fun to be able to adminstrate this website.
        <br>
        I can be reached at v205@hackclub.app.
        <br>
        Though why would you like to contact me, that's beyond me.
        <br>
        I'm <b>not kind to scams</b>, I'll tell you that.
        <br>

            <li>I like OSINT, and have also been OSINTed</li>
